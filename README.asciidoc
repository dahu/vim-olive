Vim Mode Line Verifier

Usage
-----

The command:

  :echo ValidateModelines()

Will show a list of valid modelines in the current file. Invalid lines are
omitted from the output.

This wants for a more... user-friendly and useful interface. Suggestions
welcome.

There is also a function called ++VerifyModeline(line)++ which returns a string
indicating whether the supplied line is a valid modeline or not. The first
character of the returned string is ++1++ if it is a valid modeline and ++0++
if it is not. Again, horrendous and improvements welcomed.
